# Tile-based game using CraftyJS

This is a basic web game that was made by 2 beginners who wanted to tryout [CraftyJS](http://craftyjs.com/) and
its [collision engine](http://craftyjs.com/api/Collision.html). The game was made in a few hours at
the [Berlin Mini Jam](http://berlinminijam.de/), a monthly game creation jam where people have fun, test game ideas and
build prototypes. The event took place on **2014/02/23** ([February Mini Game Dev Jam 2014](https://www.meetup.com/game-developers-berlin/events/162619382/)). The theme of the game jam was "building a game
with cubes".
